        Welcome to the JAWALAN platform! This project is a culmination of hard
        work, innovation, and a shared vision to support high school students in
        shaping their academic and professional futures. As female computer
        science students, we recognized the challenges students face when
        deciding on their career paths and excelling academically. With this in
        mind, we created JAWALANâ€”a platform designed to provide personalized
        guidance and resources to help students confidently navigate their
        educational journey.

        <p className="aboutpage-pra">
          JAWALAN was born out of a vision to empower high school students by
          bridging the gap between academic success and career exploration. We
          aim to provide a comprehensive platform that integrates learning
          tools, interest assessments, and career guidance, all tailored to the
          individual needs of each student. The project also serves as a
          testament to the creativity and innovation of women in tech,
          showcasing how technology can solve real-world problems. By using
          Artificial Intelligence, JAWALAN aims to inspire students to dream
          bigger, explore opportunities, and make informed decisions about their
          futures.

        <h2 className="aboutpage-section-title">Why We Created JAWALAN ?</h2>
        <p className="aboutpage-pra">
          As students ourselves, we understood the overwhelming task high
          schoolers face in choosing a major or career path without sufficient
          guidance. Often, existing platforms focus solely on either academic
          support or career guidance but rarely offer both in a seamless,
          integrated manner. We created JAWALAN to address this gap and provide:
